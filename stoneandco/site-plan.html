      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to get the tax office, of Stone and Company, a presence on the internet.  Firstly, it will show up in the search for a tax office near me and hopefully gain more clients every year.  Secondly, the site will have a tax organizer on it that is readily available to download for individual, rental and business returns; so the client knows which documents to bring in for their appointment.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Any person who has to file a tax return.</p>  <!-- change this -->
