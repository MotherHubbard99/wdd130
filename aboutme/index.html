   <p>Hello classmates :) I was born a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  I have lived in California and currently live in Utah.</p>
    <p> I married my sweetheart in the Salt Lake City Temple and started a family.  We had 2 children together when I became a cancer widow at the age of 33.  I later married a widower with 4 children and together we decided to add one more, or the frosting to our family. So now we have 7 children together ranging from 24 year old twins to a 6 year old. </p>
    <p>I got a Bachelor's degree, when I was 22 years old, and after my second child I was blessed to be able to be a stay at home mom for the next 10 years.  I currently work as a seasonal tax preparer. Since we now have all of our kids in school, or older, I want to work towards another degree; this time in web and computer programming. Now that I am grown up I have finally decided what I want to be...haha!</p>
    <p>Enough about me! I want to learn about you guys!</p>
